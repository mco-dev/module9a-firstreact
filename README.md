# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile and ContactCard component. The components both include a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS. They are displayed one after another.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges
Briefly describe any errors, bugs, or confusion you encountered and how you solved it.
I only ran into problems when trying to initially create the react project with the npm command. There were errors when wtrying to type in the complete command. I resolved it by only typing npm craete vite@latest, then selecting the correct options after being prompted. Everything else worked as it should. I was also able to view the pag from another computer on my home network. All of the changes I made worked correctly. The upload to github also went smoothly.

## Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your rendered component (you can drag and drop it here if using GitHub web interface).
